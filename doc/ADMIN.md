### Installation

* The package does not create a dedicated system user, rather during installation you are asked what user you want code-server to run as. **Don't give access to users you don't fully trust!**

### Limitations

* `code-server` files are stored inside `/home/<your-user>/.local/share/code-server`

### Extensions

This application uses [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/). You can change this setting from the config panel.
